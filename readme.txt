The Compute
Express Link (CXL) is an open industry-standard interconnect between processors
and devices such as accelerators, memory buffers, smart network interfaces,
persistent memory, and solid-state drives. 

 

 CXL offers coherency and memory semantics with
bandwidth that scales with PCIe bandwidth while achieving significantly lower
latency than PCIe .
